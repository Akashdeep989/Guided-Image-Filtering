# Guided-Image-Filtering
* The guided filter computes the filtering output by considering the content of a guidance image, which can be the input image itself or another different image.
*  The guided filtercan be used as an edge-preserving smoothing operator like the popular bilateral filter, but it has better behaviors near edges.
*  With the help of the guidance image, it can make the filtering output more structured and less smoothed than the input.

     ## Conclusion
   *  In this paper, I have presented a novel filter which is widely applicable in computer vision and graphics.
   * We design a new filter that exhibits the nice property of edge-preserving smoothing .
